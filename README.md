# SleepscoreRT
SleepScore RT is a web-based tool that I have developed for Norcal Hacks 2026, and it measures reaction time and accuracy to estimate a person's cognitive fatigue. It’s designed to help users compare mental performance across different times of the day (for example, morning vs. night) and observe how their alertness changes over time. 

I have reused some basic elements from a previous project, reaction drift. I have simply changed the purpose to be more health oriented/to have a better real world use case

SleepScore RT is intended as an educational and self-tracking tool. It does not diagnose medical conditions and is not a substitute for professional medical evaluation.

Some possible use cases include but are not limited to:

Comparing alertness across different sleep schedules

Visualizing changes in reaction time over time

Exploring how cognitive performance varies with fatigue
